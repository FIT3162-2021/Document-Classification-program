# TODO:
#       document code properly, and also testing
#           remember to document each class and function, with complexity, input, return, etc
#           (btw need ot double check if preconditions are documented correctly)
#           error handling//catching, such as try and except
### the use of "###" in comments indicates the comment is means as a NOTE, or a possible place to TEST, or A PROBLEM
### THAT NEEDS ADDRESSING

###### BTW, are we better off using regular expression? it is way more efficient to code now that i realize it. as for run time with regex, its probably the same

###### BTW, do we need to explain what the ARI scores actually are in documentation, and also what the classification from the ARI scores mean?

### NOTE: OUR FORMULA FOR ARI SCORE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE IN WIKIPEDIA(AND POTENTIALLY SOME OTHER SOURCES):
# OUR FORMULA IS AS BELOW
# GL = 0.50(w/s) + 4.71(s/w) - 21.43
# where GL = assigned grade level
# w/s = words per sentence or sentence length,
# s/w = characters per word or word length.
